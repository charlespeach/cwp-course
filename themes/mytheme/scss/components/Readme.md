# Components
These are the custom components used in SilverStripe Express. We have organised the scss in this way to make it easy for you to choose which components you want to use. You may also wish to place your own custom components in this directory.

To include components in layout.scss, or typography.scss, import the component at the top of the file. i.e to include the forms component, you would write:

	@import 'components/forms'; //form specific scss
